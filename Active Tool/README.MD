CODESYS Version Extractor
=========

CODESYS stands for controller development system. Itâ€™s a development environment for programming controller applications in line with the IEC 61131-3 standard. It was developed and is still maintained by the 3S (Smart Software Solutions) Company in Germany. The platform-independent development environment is compatible with approximately 1,000 different device types from over 500 manufacturers and several million devices.

Our product aimed at extracting the CODESYS version via bunch of different ways.
In light of recent events (which includes numerous CODESYS vulnerabilities) we would like to present a tool which will extract CODESYS version and allow different SOCs and IT admins to take counter measures and protect their organisation form malicious attacks.
